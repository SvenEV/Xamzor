# Xamzor
### _E**x**tensible **A**pplication **M**arkup for Bla**zor**_

Xamzor is an experimental project in which I try to prototype a set of reusable Blazor components that are familiar to XAML developers and make it easy to compose web views that feel like native apps.

The list of [Xamzor components](https://github.com/SvenEV/Xamzor/tree/master/Xamzor/UI/Components) currently includes:
* Common layout containers *(Grid, StackPanel, Border, ScrollViewer)*
* Components supporting data templates
  *(ContentControl, ItemsControl, ListView, FlipView)*
* *TextBlock, Image, Button and ProgressRing*

**You can find [Xamzor on NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamzor)**.

*(you can find the original, native Windows 10 version of [Mensa UPB in the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRDKRSX))*

## About Blazor
[Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) is "an experimental web UI framework using C#/Razor and HTML, running in the browser via WebAssembly". It is a project from the ASP.NET team at Microsoft. Even if you are not a fan of my work, you should definitely [check out Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor).
